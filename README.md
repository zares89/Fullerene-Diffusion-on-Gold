# Fullerene-Diffusion-on-Gold
This FORTRAN code runs a molecular dynamics simulation in NVT ensemble for the diffusion of a fullerene particle on a gold substrate. Sutton-Chen and Tersoff potentials are used for fullerene and gold respectively. The Gold-Fullerene interaction is calculated based on a 12-6 LJ potential.
